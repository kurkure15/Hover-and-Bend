                                <span class="tile__cta"> Ankur slipped out the back door just as the first streaks of apricot light brushed the sky. He padded across the dew-tipped grass and took his usual seat on the cool concrete step beside the little flower bed he'd planted last month.

                                    Before he could settle in, Blue—his golden retriever, morning enthusiast and perpetual optimist—bounded up, plopped down at his side, and rested a warm paw on Ankur's boot, as if to say "Ready when you are."
                                    
                                    "Patience, buddy," Ankur chuckled, scratching behind Blue's velvet ears. "The day's barely awake."
